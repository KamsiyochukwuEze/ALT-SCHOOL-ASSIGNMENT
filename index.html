             <h2>Biography</h2>
              <p class="body"> 
                I'm Kamsiyochukwu Eze, 20, Igbo, from Enugu Nigeria; I've had an
                  unhealthy obsession for technology and Computers for as long as I 
                  can remember. Prior to joining Alt School, I used to be a  freelance 
                  graphic designer and personal assistant at a law firm. Due to my experience as 
                  an assistant, I have strong communication and teamwork skills. My Hobbies include
                  travelling, reading and reserach that often leads me to a rabbithole of information. As an
                  introvert, I spend a great deal of my time alone and try to pick up as much skills
                  as I can.

            <h2>Why Alt School Africa</h2>
            <p class="body">
                I heard about Alt School Africa for the first time on X(Formerly Twitter)
                in 2022 from Hacksultan. I knew I was intrested in pursuing a career in Tech but I didn't know how to go about it until I came across Hacksultan's post about Alt school
                I did a personal research on Alt School Africa and it aligned perfectly with what I wanted; 
                learning circles, Live classes and 24/7 support from instructors, plus a community; which I feel
                is the most important thing. Unfortunately I wasn't able to join till 2024. I recieved a 50%
                scholarship from KiKi Mordi which enabled me to actualize my dreams of being an Alt Schooler.
